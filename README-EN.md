# Course "Storming STM32"

> [Для русскоговорящих](https://github.com/chrns/stm32/blob/master/README-EN.md)

## Goal and objectives for the course

The main goal of this course is an attempt to demonstrate the entire life cycle of a digital device: from the initial idea to realization and product management.  The primary objectives are to learn to work with technical documentation, demonstrate the basics of programming a microcontroller device, and to explain how the device was designed (from conception to circuit implementation to the final implementation and operation of the device).

## Requirements
The minimal level of competency at which to pass this course assumes the ability to write simple programs in C language using arithmetic, Boolean and bitwise operations. Also necessary is the ability to use loops and conditions, write functions, and analyze simple electronic circuits. An understanding of procedural and modular programming, as well as of Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s law is required.

>To fully pass the course, you will need either to purchase components according to the specifications and make or factory order a circuit board, or [buy](http://stm32.chrns.com/#donate) a pre-packaged set.
